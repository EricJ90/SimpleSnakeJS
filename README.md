# SimpleSnakeJS
A simple Snake game implemented with JS, HTML, and CSS.

# Why so many comments?
It is heavily commented to help new coders learn how the game was built. I tried to make the comments as helpful as I could.

# About this repo
This is a simple project I worked on over the course of a few days. It's very basic right now but functions as a rudimentary game. You can copy this game and place it wherever you'd like.
Despite what github says, it does use JS and CSS, they're just all inline.
The game is written entirely in one HTML document to keep it small and very simple.

# To run 
Simply download the HTML file and run it in any modern browser.
Control the snake with the arrow keys.

# How to contribute
There are a ton of ways to make this better. Feel free to fork the repo and add new features. If they work well and they add to the game, I'll merge them.

Currently, I'm working on adding an ending screen instead of an alert() when you lose the game. As it stands now, the page reloads to restart and that's not efficient.
