# SimpleSnakeJS
A simple Snake game implemented with JS, HTML, and CSS

# About this repo
This is a simple project I worked on over the course of a few days. It's very basic right now but functions as a rudimentary game. You can copy this game and place it wherever you'd like.
The game is written entirely in one HTML document to keep it small and very simple. 

# To run 
Simply download the HTML file and run it in any modern browser.
Control the snake with the arrow keys. The game will start automatically when you press an arrow key after you open the page

# How to contribute
There are a ton of ways to make this better. Feel free to fork the repo and add new features. If they work well, I'll merge them.
